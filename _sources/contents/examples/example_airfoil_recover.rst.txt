Airfoil (Recover)
=================

Problem description
-------------------

This example continues from the  previous one to demonstrate the
dehomogenization analysis. It is assumed that a 1D beam analysis has
been finished, and data of global deformations and loads have been
added to the main input file correctly
(:ref:`See the recover section <section-recover>`). Suppose that the
results in :numref:`Table %s <table_mh104_1dresults>` are used and
default values are kept for others. All files generated from the VABS
homogenization analysis are kept in the same place as input files.
Final visualization is required and the contour plot of one of the
stress components is shown in :numref:`Fig. %s <fig_mh104r>`.
Complete files can be found in ``examples\ex_airfoil_r\``, including
``mh104.xml``, ``basepoints.dat``, ``baselines.xml``, ``materials.xml``,
``layups.xml``, ``mh104.sg``, ``mh104.sg.ech``,
``mh104.sg.K``, ``mh104.sg.opt``, ``mh104.sg.v0``,
``mh104.sg.v1S``, and ``mh104.sg.v22``.
